## About Me
At the moment I have been working for a private company engaged in metalworking and manufacturing of parts as a process engineer for 2,5 years. Before graduation, he worked as a loader and a member of the team of a restaurant in a fast food chain. My goal is to become a Front-end developer, since this area has long attracted me and the main thing in it is constant development in a professional sense, which I consider a huge plus. I am ready to constantly learn, develop and move only in front to achieve my goals.
